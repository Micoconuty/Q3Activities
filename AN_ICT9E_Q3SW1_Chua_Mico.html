					Finn Mertens, also known as Finn the Human, is a fictional character and one of the two protagonists in the American animated television series Adventure Time created by Pendleton Ward. He also appeared in the spin-off series Adventure Time: Distant Lands. He is voiced by Jeremy Shada in most appearances. The character made his debut in the original pilot, where he is named Pen and voiced by Zack Shada, Jeremy's older brother. Jonathan Frakes voices Finn as an adult in some appearances.
					<br><br>
					Prior to the start of Adventure Time, Finn was adopted as an infant by two anthropomorphic dogs named Joshua and Margaret, who found him in the woods. His best friend and adoptive brother Jake the Dog (John DiMaggio) accompanies him on many of his adventures in Ooo, the fictional world that the series is set in. The mystery surrounding Finn's origins and whether he is the last human left in Ooo is a major part of the character's narrative arc. Later in the series, it is revealed that there are other humans still living in Ooo and that Finn's parents Martin and Minerva came from a community of survivors living on a chain of islands.

	<h3>Jake the Dog</h3>

			<div class="col-10"> 
				<br>
				Jake the Dog is a fictional character and one of the two protagonists in the American animated television series Adventure Time created by Pendleton Ward. He also appeared in the spin-off series Adventure Time: Distant Lands. He is voiced by John DiMaggio. The character made his debut in the original pilot. During the events of the show, Jake says that he is 28 "magical dog years" old.
				<br><br>
				Jake can stretch, shrink, or mold any part of his body to any shape and almost any size, ranging from becoming gigantic to becoming incredibly small. He acts as a confident mentor to his energetic adopted brother Finn the Human, though he tends to give somewhat questionable advice. His powers help Finn considerably in combat and transportation but are sometimes used as nothing more than pleasant forms of expression. He has a girlfriend named "Lady Rainicorn" (voiced by Niki Yang); they have five children together, as seen in "Jake the Dad". He is quite skilled at playing the viola, which houses a worm named "Shelby Butterson the Worm Who Lives in Jake's Viola".

				Princess Bonnibel Bubblegum (also called Bonnie or PB, occasionally P-bubs) is a fictional character in the American animated television series Adventure Time, created by Pendleton Ward. She is voiced by Hynden Walch.
				<br><br>
				Princess Bubblegum rules the Candy Kingdom, which other "Candy People" inhabit. She is good friends with the series' protagonists Finn the Human and Jake the Dog, first appearing with them in Ward's 2008 pilot. Bonnie's sexuality has not been officially confirmed. Reviewers have argued that she is either bisexual, non-binary, queer, lesbian, or a combination of some of the latter, as both live in a world where "sexuality is somewhat fluid."[10] In the series finale of Adventure Time, "Come Along with Me", Bonnie and Marcy shared on-screen kiss, confirming their relationship.

	<h3>BMO</h3>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-10">
				<br>
				BMO, an acronym standing for "Be MOre" and sometimes written phonetically as "Beemo", is a MO-series video game console system/computer/VCR combo unit who lives with Finn and Jake. Despite being voiced by a female voice actress (Niki Yang, who considers BMO as male) BMO has no definite gender, and characters (including BMO) refer to BMO in a variety of ways throughout the show, including using both male and female pronouns, as well as terms such as "m'lady" or "little living boy".

			<div class="col-10">
				Ice King is a recurring antagonist-turned-supporting protagonist of the series, and is 1,043 years old. The Ice King frequently steals princesses throughout Ooo to forcefully marry them, Princess Bubblegum being his usual target. His ice-based magic abilities come from a magical crown he wears, which directly causes his insanity.
